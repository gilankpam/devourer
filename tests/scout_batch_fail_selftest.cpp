/* scout_batch_fail_selftest.cpp — RtlJaguar3Device::GetRxEnergyScout must NOT
 * write a composed BB reset built out of a FAILED read.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST IS MANDATORY AND THE OTHERS ARE NOT. The scout's reset dwords
 * 0x1d2c (RX clock gate) and 0x1eb4 are read, bit-twiddled and written back as
 * FULL DWORDS. While they were read through rtw_read, a dead register bus
 * threw and nothing was written. Reading them inside a ctrl_batch changed the
 * failure mode from "throw" to "returns false, leaves op.value at the 0 it was
 * constructed with" — so one cancelled, timed-out or short read on either op
 * would have composed 0x00000000/0x80000000 into 0x1d2c and
 * 0x02000000/0x00000000 into 0x1eb4, clobbering every other bit in two live BB
 * registers. The card goes deaf and STAYS deaf, because the next scout call
 * reads the corrupted value and writes it straight back.
 *
 * And it is invisible: valid_fa=false merely drops the sample, and
 * scout_read_bench's counter-plausibility tripwire is itself gated on
 * valid_fa, so the bench cannot see it either. A silent corruption with no
 * observable symptom short of a deaf radio is exactly the case that has to be
 * pinned by a test rather than by a comment.
 *
 * The fake transport overrides ctrl_batch to reproduce the ONE UsbTransport
 * failure semantic this test turns on: a failed read op keeps the value it was
 * constructed with, and the call returns false. It deliberately does not model
 * the rest — UsbTransport also skips an op whose submit failed and skips the
 * remainder of a chunk after a wait gives up, and it can finish a remainder
 * synchronously. Immaterial here (an all-read group, and the bail-out keys on
 * the return value alone), but the fake is not a stand-in for the transport. */
