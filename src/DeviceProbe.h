/* Pre-open device probe: "would CreateRtlDevice know what to do with this?"
 * answered WITHOUT claiming the interface or resetting the device.
 *
 * Motivation: a host with several adapters (a diversity ground station) has to
 * decide which USB devices are its radios. Doing that by opening each one the
 * normal way is destructive -- devourer::claim_interface_then_reset detaches
 * the kernel driver and resets the port, which is not something to do to a
 * card reader that happens to share the Realtek VID. This path costs one
 * device-recipient vendor control read; an unrelated device STALLs it and is
 * left otherwise untouched.
 *
 * The dispatch below MUST mirror WiFiDriver::CreateRtlDevice: same ids, same
 * order (PID-gated generations first -- on AX silicon 0x00FC is a different
 * register -- then the SYS_CFG2 byte). tests/device_probe_selftest.cpp is the
 * guard against the two drifting.
 *
 * One deliberate difference: the factory falls back to Jaguar1 for an
 * unrecognised chip-id, which is right when a caller has already decided this
 * device IS its radio. A probe asking "is this a radio at all" must not adopt
 * every byte it doesn't recognise, so Unknown means unknown here. */
