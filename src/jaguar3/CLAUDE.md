# src/jaguar3/ — Jaguar3 (11ac gen3) working context

Deep per-generation facts for this subtree, loaded alongside the root
CLAUDE.md. Chips: rtl8822c (RTL8812CU/8822CU, chip-id `0x13`) and rtl8822e
(RTL8812EU/8822EU, chip-id `0x17`).

## HAL layout

`RtlJaguar3Device`, `HalJaguar3` (power seq, table apply, 3-wire RF, bf_init,
efuse incl. 8822e OTP burst-mode), `HalmacJaguar3Fw`/`MacInit`,
`RadioManagementJaguar3` (channel/BW/per-path power, the `0x9b0`/`0x9b4`
narrowband dividers, RF18 encoding), strategy interfaces `Jaguar3Calibration`
→ `Halrf8822c`/`Halrf8822e` and `Jaguar3PhyTables` (its own
`PhyTableLoaderJaguar3`, separate from the Jaguar1/2 `PhyTableLoader`).

## Chip facts

- **Coex runtime thread** (`RtlJaguar3Device::coex_runtime_loop`, started in
  `InitWrite`): sustained 5 GHz TX needs it — without its ~2 s WiFi-only coex
  re-apply + FW heartbeats, the combo chip's coex firmware silences the
  antenna. It also drains C2H, so TX-only sessions still see `tx.report`.
- **5/10 MHz narrowband**: the re-clock lives in the `0x9b0`/`0x9b4`
  dividers (vs the `0x8ac` block the Jaguar1/2 chips share). 80 MHz works,
  incl. a 40-in-80 frame via TX-descriptor DATA_SC. See `docs/narrowband.md`.
- halrf calibration: DACK/IQK/TXGAPK/thermal tracking.
- **Firmware channel switch** (H2C 0x1D via `fastretune_fw`, both dies): the
  fw-switch H2C must ride `HalJaguar3::send_h2c_raw`'s HMEBOX box counter —
  the coex runtime thread shares it (both callers hold `_reg_mu`); a second
  counter would corrupt the mailbox rotation. On the 8822C the fw and sw
  fast paths tie on-air (~2.3 ms — RF settle dominates); the fw win is ~3×
  lower per-hop host/USB cost, plus ~2.6 ms cross-band. 8822E spur channels
  decline every fast path, fw included.
- `DEVOURER_TX_WITH_RX=thread` must be set **before** `InitWrite` — the
  bring-up keeps the RX filters open; retrofitting RX later is unreliable.
- The rtl8822e's hardware-bisected constraints (DPDT/pin-mux front end,
  single-path 1SS TX, spur channels, LCK, the 2.4 GHz TX kernel-parity
  limitation) live in `docs/8822e-quirks.md`.
- **Absolute noise floor = NHM, not an idle-noise report.** The 8822C/E have
  no vendor idle-noise path (phydm_noisemonitor.c returns 0 for them; the
  vendor ACS never asks). `GetRxEnergy(with_nhm)` under
  `DEVOURER_RX_NOISE_FLOOR` runs a second NHM window with absolute thresholds
  and cca/tx-on excluded (the vendor ACS recipe) and averages the occupied
  buckets — `src/NoiseFloorMath.h`, `docs/rx-spectrum-sensing.md`. On air:
  −95/−96 dBm on 5 GHz once settled, but the BB's power estimate is FROZEN
  (one constant value, single-bucket histogram) for the first 1-7 s and for
  most of a 2.4 GHz session — rejected as null by the peak-bucket guard;
  trigger unidentified. Beware the masked BB write shifts the value to the
  mask: the NHM th[8..10] writes were
  double-shifted (read back 0) until the selftest pinned them.
- **PROTOCOL_EN must be set before the LLT init.** halmac writes
  `MAC_TRX_ENABLE = 0xFF` to `REG_CR` just before the auto-LLT init; this port
  wrote the DMA-only `0x0F`. Without PROTOCOL_EN (bit 4) at that moment the
  TX page allocator never terminates the data ring at `rsvd_boundary`: a
  sustained load runs into the reserved region and overwrites the beacon
  page, and the next TBTT latches `TXDMA_STATUS` `BIT_TXPKTBUF_REQ_ERR` - TX
  dead for the life of the process. Bisected on an 8812CU: `0x1F` (DMA +
  PROTOCOL) clean; `0x2F` (+SCHEDULE) and `0xCF` (+MACTX/MACRX) fault. The
  later full-CR write (`0x06FF`) is too late. The code uses the vendor's full
  `0xFF`; the 8822E was fixed with it (its `0x0F` control faulted at 172
  frames, `0xFF` ran 4000/4000) and not bisected. With it the hardware
  writes `LLT[rsvd_boundary - 1] = 0` itself by the end of a run past one
  traversal; the LLT reads `0x792` at init either way (8822C and 8822E, and
  the vendor driver's chip too), so an init-time LLT read proves nothing -
  inject past a wrap with a beacon armed (the `txdemo`
  `DEVOURER_TX_BEACON_TU` command in `docs/jaguar3-tx-ring.md` - it needs
  data-sized frames and the RX thread) and read it after
  (`IRtlRadio::ReadPacketBuffer`, sel 1). Found by diffing the vendor's
  usbmon register writes against ours from the TRX enable to the LLT init:
  `REG_CR` was the one difference. Plain injection never showed it - no
  beacon engine reads the page. `GENERAL_INFO`/`PHYDM_INFO` H2C packets were
  ruled out as the mechanism (sent byte-exact, consumed by the firmware, no
  effect on the LLT).
  Record: `docs/jaguar3-tx-ring.md`.
- **Data frames leave the HIGH queue.** The QSEL order, the queue ->
  endpoint map and its endpoint-count rule are `TxQueueMap.h`'s contract;
  the send-path split and the `DEVOURER_TX_EP` override are
  `RtlJaguar3Device.h`'s (`peek_tx_qsel`, `tx_ep_for_qsel`); which frames
  A-MPDU applies to is `src/AmpduMode.h`'s. Measured, on an 8812CU (bulk-OUT
  HIGH 0x05, NORMAL 0x06, LOW 0x08): QSEL and endpoint must agree - moving
  QSEL alone changed nothing (HIGH still drained 64 -> 0); the endpoint alone
  was not run (a reviewer predicted `TXDMA_STATUS`'s `EP_QSEL_DIFF` bit).
  2026-09-27: `DEVOURER_TX_EP=0x06` put every send on EP 6 with 0 failed; the
  aggregated path (`DEVOURER_TX_BATCH=4` + `DEVOURER_TX_USB_AGG=4`) and
  A-MPDU over QoS data ran with 0 failed. Unmeasured: 1-, 2- and 4-endpoint
  parts.

## Bring-up cost and the pipelined register writes

`InitWrite` is ~14k USB register transfers and nothing else. The stage
timing shows it: `init.timing` events under the `j3hal.*` (HAL bring-up)
and `j3init.*` (`InitWrite`) scopes, field schema in `src/InitTimer.h` /
`docs/logging.md`; `bench_init.py` parses them but reports only `ms`. The
batching contract itself — ordering, what waits, single-threadedness,
failure propagation — is documented once, at `ITransport::write_batch_begin`
(`src/Transport.h`) and in `UsbTransport`; this file carries only how
Jaguar3 uses it:

- `InitWrite` runs its whole bring-up inside one `WriteBatchScope`
  (`RtlJaguar3Device.cpp`), ended before the coex thread starts because that
  thread shares the transport. A queued write that completed failed or
  short fails the batch close, and `InitWrite` throws there rather than
  start the coex thread over an incompletely programmed chip. `Init`
  (RX-only) opens no batch yet — not measured on a ground-station card.
- Every settle delay drains the queue first, µs ones included, on both
  dies: the `write_bb` / `rf_writer` table delay markers, `delay_us` and
  `delay_ms` on `Halrf8822c` and `Halrf8822e`, the efuse power-cut. A settle
  that sleeps while its writes are still queued is no settle; the drain is
  free on an empty queue and bounded by its depth otherwise.
- Measured: 1.30 → 0.65 s warm, 2.04 → ~0.7 s cold on one drone-side
  8812EU (ssc338q host). The transfer-count reduction is deterministic; the
  wall-clock figure is one unit, one host.

The RF radio-table load is write-only: bits [31:20] of the direct window
(`0x3c00`/`0x4c00 + addr*4`) are not storage, so the vendor's `MASK20BITS`
read-modify-write preserved nothing at the price of a synchronous read per
entry. Scope of that claim (`tests/j3_rf_window_readback.sh`): every one of
the 512 window words (both paths) poked with the high 12 bits set read back
0, on one 8812CU and one 8812EU; the post-bring-up histogram (all 512 words
0) is only a control, since the write-only load itself clears those bits.

## Runtime batched EP0 (`ctrl_batch`) — the scout read and the cached hop

The same slot pool, driven at runtime instead of during bring-up.
`ITransport::ctrl_batch` (contract + the USB hazards are doc-commented at
the declaration in `src/Transport.h` and at the definition in
`src/UsbTransport.cpp` — read those, not a copy here) submits a group of EP0
reads/writes back to back and pays one completion wait per chunk. Two Jaguar3
callers, both holding `_reg_mu` across the whole group:

- **`GetRxEnergyScout()`** — the cheapest frame-free OFDM FA + CCA delta the
  chip offers, for a caller dwelling a few ms per candidate channel. 8 reads
  then a 4-write reset composed in memory from two of them (`ScoutEnergyMath.h`
  — composed full dwords, never `phy_set_bb_reg`, which on this generation
  costs a read-modify-write *and* hits the double-shift gotcha). Two groups,
  because the writes depend on the reads. It deliberately skips the CCK reset
  toggles, so `fa_cck`/`cca_cck` come back 0 with **no reset behind that 0** —
  hence `RxEnergy::valid_cck`, which every consumer folding the CCK half into
  an occupancy estimate must gate on. Skipping a reset is not free either: the
  OFDM counters keep accumulating, so the *next* sample's rate is inflated
  (bounded by the coex tick's own reset).
- **`RadioManagementJaguar3::fast_retune`** — the 9–11 composed hop writes go
  in one `ctrl_batch`, flushed early only where a helper (`apply_rxbb`,
  `select_agc_tables`) writes registers itself. A failed batch is **not**
  swallowed the way the per-register writes it replaced were: it fails
  wholesale, so the fast-path caches are dropped (`invalidate_fast_caches`)
  and the hop resyncs through the full `set_channel_bwmode`.

The two hosts measured disagree completely — the 12-op scout read gets ~5.6×
faster batched on an RK3566 aarch64 host and not at all on an x86 xHCI host
(there the per-transfer cost is wire time, not host turnaround); both are
floors taken with no RX loop. Numbers and method: `tests/scout_read_bench.cpp`.
`DEVOURER_CTRL_BATCH=0` (`DeviceConfig::usb.ctrl_batch`, default on) is the
A/B knob.

Two costs recorded on that bench file and the `ctrl_batch` definition rather
than fixed here: `tx_async`/`tx_sync` open with `flush_writes()`, so a send
landing mid-group blocks on it; and an RX `on_data` callback can be reaped on the batching thread, so nothing reachable
from it may take `_reg_mu` (`cfo_tick()` does — latent only because
`DEVOURER_CFO_TRACK` defaults off).

## TX power

Both dies drive the SAME TXAGC block (`set_tx_power_ref` is the port of
`rtw8822c_set_write_tx_power_ref`): per-path references at
`0x18e8`/`0x41e8[16:10]` (OFDM/HT/VHT) and `0x18a0`/`0x41a0[22:16]` (CCK),
plus a per-rate DIFF table at `0x3a00 + (hw_rate & 0xfc)` — 4 rates per dword,
7-bit two's-complement, so `[-64, 63]`. Every TXAGC write must be preceded by
clearing the `0x1c90[15]` gate. The diff table is offset-invariant (an offset
shifts the reference; the shape rides on top), so a runtime offset step is ~8
register writes instead of 8 + 32.

The one real divergence is the *default shape*: the **E** derives per-path
references from the efuse power-by-rate table and walks `phy_reg_pg` for the
diffs; the **C** uses a flat `JAGUAR3_TXPWR_REF_BASE_8822C` on both paths with
no calibrated shape underneath. A caller table (`SetTxPowerRateDiffs`) replaces
that shape on either die. Note the 2SS consequence on the 2T2R C: the caller
struct describes the 1SS ladder only, so MCS8..15 stay at the reference while
MCS0..7 carries the caller's shape.

`GetTxPowerState` reads the references back from the chip (`hw_readback=true`),
but the diff half is the software copy — `0x3a00` is not read back.

## Per-packet TX power

The descriptor `TXPWR_OFSET_TYPE` is a bank *selector*: types 2/3 pick two
programmable 7-bit-signed power-index offsets in BB `0x1e70[31:16]`
(~1 dB/step, `DEVOURER_TXPKT_STEP_QDB` recalibrates), LRU-managed by
`SetTxPacketPowerOffsetQdb` (`TxPktPwrBanks.h`) — the banks reset *disabled*
at BB-table load, so the descriptor field alone is inert until programmed
(types 0/1 = per-STA BB-RAM by descriptor MACID, left as the 0 dB baseline).
On-air-validated on 8822CU + 8822EU, sticky across
`SetMonitorChannel`/`FastRetune`; the E compresses deep cuts (≈−6 dB floor,
same TSSI reshape as its offset slope).

## CCX energy sensing (`clm` / `nhm_env`)

**`Stop()` forgets any armed busy window** — the rule, and the residual it
does not close, are at `IRadio::ArmChannelBusy`, the one declaration site
where they can be kept true. What is specific to this die:

Measured on an RTL8812CU with the reset removed: arm, `Stop()`, retune, read
reports `spoil=retuned`; with it, `spoil=none` and no reading (`Stop()` runs
`rtw_hal_deinit()`). The reset sits OUTSIDE `_reg_mu`, unlike the RTL8733B's,
and deliberately: `Stop()` joins the coex thread, and that thread takes
`_reg_mu`, so holding it across the join would deadlock. The coex loop never
takes the CCX lock, which is what makes this ordering safe.

**An armed busy window (`ArmChannelBusy`) is DESTROYED by an NHM read on this
map.** Measured on an RTL8812CU: a clean 240 ms window read 60.4-61.6% under
load, while the same window with one `GetRxEnergy(with_nhm=true)` mid-way came
back as the 2 ms re-arm (311-326 of 62500 ticks). The 11AC families survive the
same intrusion and merely read 3-4 points high, so this is the generation where
the shared-engine rule is not optional. `GetRxQuality()` takes that NHM read,
which makes the trap easy to spring from a caller that never touches the busy
API.

`GetRxEnergy(with_nhm=true)` runs the shared CCX window (`src/NhmReader.h`) on
the JGR3 register map (CLM period is the low half of `0x1e40`, trigger
`0x1e60[0]`, ready+result `0x2d88`); on-air validated on an RTL8812CU, ch100.

This is the generation where `nhm_env` works as intended, because
`PhydmRuntimeJaguar3.cpp` clamps DIG to `DIG_MIN_COVERAGE 0x1e` …
`DIG_MAX_OF_MIN_COVERAGE 0x22` — four steps — so the gain reference barely
moves and the histogram mass is free to march up under an interferer. Against a
5 MHz non-802.11 carrier on a traffic-free channel: 0 frames decoded, `clm` 6,
`nhm_env` 56, against a quiet 0/0/0; 802.11 traffic at MCS1 read 606 frames /
15 / 15. The discriminator is the ratio — `nhm_env`/`clm` ≈ 1 under 802.11, ≈ 9
under the carrier. Note `fa_ofdm` moved 0 → 1776 on that same arm and remains
the more sensitive counter, and that the magnitudes are session-specific (an
earlier run of the same arms read 34 / 98 with `fa_ofdm` 2926 — a stronger
carrier at the receiver for the same SDR gain). Compare arms within one
session.

In a **TX session** with a 300 ms quiet window the counters are alive (clean
0/0/0, carrier `clm` 5 / `fa` 1118 / `cca` 1122) — on the same 8812CU and code
path that previously read *inert* with 4–20 ms windows, so window length rather
than generation is the live variable in that older result.

## Busy-airtime NHM (ArmNhmBusy / ReadNhmBusy)

Non-blocking NHM window for a caller that wants airtime, not a floor:
cfg 0x3 (inc_cca ON so 802.11 frames count, inc_tx OFF), the levels fixed to
`nf::kNhmAbsThDbm` (no caller-chosen thresholds), composed as full dwords in
`NhmBusyMath.h`. Arm at the start of a window, read at the end; not-ready
reads come back invalid, never block. `NhmBusy.period` is the LAST arm's
period on this device — a caller compares it with its own to detect that
another caller re-armed in between. `read_nhm`/`read_nhm_absolute` are NOT
built on this path. Unvalidated on air in this repo — no in-repo consumer.

- **Recipe cache.** Holds the composed `0x1e40`/`0x1e60` dwords, which the
  CLM busy window (`ArmChannelBusy`) shares; cleared by every CCX access
  through `with_ccx`, by `GetRxEnergy(with_nhm)` — including via
  `GetRxQuality()` —, `SetMonitorChannel`, `Init` and `InitWrite`. It survives `FastRetune` (the hop does not touch
  `0x1e40`/`0x1e60`), so a window in flight across a hop spans both
  channels — arm after the hop.
- **The FA/CCA counter reset does not touch it.** phydm's "reset all
  counter" (`0x1eb4[25]`, pulsed by `GetRxEnergy`, `GetRxEnergyScout` and
  the coex thread's ~2 s `fa_stats` tick) leaves an in-flight window
  intact. Measured on one 8812EU, 5 GHz ch 144, against a 100/100 ms
  square-wave jam with 200 ms windows: windows pulsed 150 ms in read
  48.3 % busy, sd 0.4 over 200 — identical to unpulsed ones (sd 0.5) —
  where 50 ms windows on the same jam spread 0–97 % (sd 39.5), so a
  window cleared to its last 50 ms could not have hidden. The ready bit
  and the 255 sum were unaffected too. One unit, one channel; 2.4 GHz
  and the 8822C not checked.
- **It spoils an armed CLM window.** The NHM trigger re-arms the shared
  engine, so `ArmNhmBusy` notes itself as an NHM read (see "CCX energy
  sensing" below): a CLM window it lands inside reads back spoiled, never
  as a valid short one. Use one busy facility per card at a time.
- **Frozen power estimate.** The BB power estimate can be frozen (a
  single-bucket histogram at a fixed level) after bring-up, after a
  `FastRetune` and on 2.4 GHz, and `ReadNhmBusy` does not reject it. A
  caller must apply the same peak-bucket test as `nf::nhm_abs_floor_dbm`
  (`kNhmFrozenBucket`) before reading the buckets as airtime.
